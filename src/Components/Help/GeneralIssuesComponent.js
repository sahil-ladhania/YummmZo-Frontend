                                    We value our customer's time and hence moved away from a single customer care number to a comprehensive chat- <br />based support system for quick and easy resolution. You no longer have to go through the maze of an IVRS call support. <br /> Just search for your issue in the help section on this page and initiate a chat with us. A customer care executive will be <br /> assigned to you shortly.
